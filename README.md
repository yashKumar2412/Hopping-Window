# Hopping-Window
As part of my Enterprise Distributed Systems course, I implemented a simple application to demonstrate aggregation over hopping windows. 

The application randomly generates 100 data points for temperature readings, aggregating the data and calculating the mean temperature over previous hour, current hour, and next hour. It also creates a visualization to show the data points and corresponding hopping mean data.

The report for this can be found in the Hopping Window Assignment Report file.
